## 🚀 Description
**PQ‑ACE** is a web platform that aggregates past exam/training questions to help users study more effectively and deepen their understanding before test day.  
We built this to tackle the frustration of scattered and inaccessible study materials—users can now access, practice, and track key questions in one centralized interface.

**Why it matters:**  
- Consolidates resources for focused studying  
- Improves retention with spaced repetition  
- Empowers students, professionals, and lifelong learners with actionable insights

**What we learned:**  
Through PQ‑ACE, we strengthened our skills in full‑stack development, API integration, user authentication, and database design.
